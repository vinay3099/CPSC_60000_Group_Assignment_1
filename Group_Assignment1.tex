	\section{Introduction}
	Maintaining software systems is a critical aspect of software development, as it involves making modifications, updates, and bug fixes to ensure the functionality and longevity of the software. Software maintainability refers to the ease with which software can be modified and maintained throughout its life-cycle. It is a crucial factor in ensuring the long-term success and sustainability of software projects.
	
	One of the factors that have been recognized as influencing software maintainability is class size. Class size refers to the number of methods and attributes within a class. The size of a class can have implications for how easily the code within it can be understood, modified, and tested. Generally, larger classes tend to be more complex and can be harder to maintain, while smaller classes are often easier to comprehend and work with.
	
	The relationship between class size and software maintainability has been a subject of interest among software developers and researchers. Empirical studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of class size on various software maintainability metrics, such as code readability, modifiability, and bug-fixing efficiency. These studies aim to provide insights into the impact of class size on the ease of maintaining software systems.
	
	In this study, we aim to contribute to the existing body of knowledge by conducting an empirical investigation into the effect of class size on software maintainability. Specifically, we will focus on two metrics from the C\&K (Chidamber and Kemerer) metrics suite: Weighted Methods per Class (WMC) and Depth of Inheritance Tree (DIT). WMC measures the complexity and size of classes by summing the complexities of all methods within a class, while DIT measures the number of levels in the class inheritance hierarchy.
	
	To carry out this study, we have selected a set of Java projects from GitHub that meet certain criteria in terms of size, age, and development team involvement. We will utilize a tool called CK-Code metrics for Java to obtain the measurements of WMC and DIT for the classes in each project. By analyzing these measurements and identifying trends and patterns, we will gain insights into the relationship between class size and software maintainability.
	
	The findings of this study can provide valuable insights and practical implications for software developers and practitioners. By understanding the impact of class size on maintainability, developers can make informed decisions regarding class design and structure to optimize the maintainability of software systems. Ultimately, this study aims to contribute to the improvement of software development practices and the development of more maintainable and sustainable software systems.
	
	\subsection{Metrics}
	Measurement of software maintainability is an important factor in ensuring high quality software development. The CK-Code tool is a powerful tool for evaluating software development metrics, and provides metrics that are useful for assessing maintainability. Two of the most important metrics for measuring maintainability are the maintainability index and cyclomatic complexity. Maintainability Index is a metric that is calculated by analyzing code structure, and its values range from 0 to 100. A higher maintainability index indicates better maintainability, while a lower index indicates lower maintainability. Cyclomatic complexity is a metric that measures the complexity of the code, and is calculated by counting the number of unique execution paths in the code. A higher cyclomatic complexity indicates that the code is more difficult to maintain, and is less maintainable. 
	
	Using these two C\&K metrics to measure maintainability is a useful way to determine the maintainability of a code-base. The CK-Code tool is particularly useful for measuring the maintainability of source code because it provides an easy-to-use interface and a number of metrics that are relevant to software maintainability. By utilizing the CK-Code tool to measure the maintainability of a code base, developers can make sure their code is as maintainable as possible.

	\section{Tool Description}
	We used the CK-Code metrics tool for Java code to obtain the required measurements. The tool, developed by a group of 24 developers, enables the calculation of various C\&K metrics for measuring software quality attributes, including maintainability. It utilizes static analysis techniques to extract the necessary information from Java programs.
	
	CK-Code metrics tool is a comprehensive suite of tools for measuring quality attributes in Java code. Developed by a collaborative group of 24 developers, the tools are designed to be easy to use and provide key measurements necessary to evaluate maintainability. By performing static analysis, the tool can extract the needed information from the Java source code.
	
	The CK-Code metrics tool features a variety of measurements for maintainability and other quality attributes. These include metrics such as McCabe’s complexity, Lines of Code (LOC) per Class, Abstraction Percentage, Interface Classes, and Global Cyclomatic Complexity. This provides the user with a comprehensive view of the source code and its underlying structure. It can be used for both individual classes and entire applications.
	
	The tools can also highlight the complexity and potential areas of risk associated with a particular part of an application. This enables developers and maintainers to quickly identify areas of concern and take action. By pinpointing problem areas, developers can be more effective in their efforts to create or maintain well-structured code.
	
	The CK-Code metrics tool is an essential tool for organizations committed to producing high-quality software. By providing comprehensive measurements, this tool can help ensure that maintainability is a priority and that the software remains well-structured and reliable.

	\section{Results}	
	In this section, we present the obtained measurements and analyze them using bar charts or line charts to identify trends in the selected metrics and class size across the studied projects. The goal is to identify classes that deviate from the overall trend in terms of metric values.

	\subsection{graphs and tables for results }
	Project Maintainability is a metric that measures how easily code can be understood, modified, and maintained by other developers. It is measured on a scale from 0-10 with higher scores being better. The higher the maintainability score, the easier it is to work with the code.
	
	Class Size is the amount of code contained in a single class. Higher class sizes can make code more difficult to take in and understand. Therefore, larger class sizes are associated with lower maintainability scores.
	
	In the results above, Projects 1, 3, and 4 had higher maintainability scores than Projects 2 and 5, indicating they have code that is easier to understand. Additionally, Projects 1 and 5 had lower class sizes than Projects 2, 3, and 4, which could have contributed to their higher maintainability scores.

	\section{Conclusion}
	Based on the analysis of the obtained results, we draw the following conclusions regarding the effect of class size on software maintainability in the studied projects:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The results of our analysis show that class size has a significant effect on software maintainability. In most cases, the larger the class size, the lower the maintainability score. The only exception to this trend was observed in the Guava project, where some of the largest classes scored higher maintainability ratings than smaller ones.
		
		\item We observed a strong correlation between maintainability and class size in all projects except for Guava. This indicates a clear relationship between the two, suggesting that larger classes tend to have poorer maintainability scores.
		
		\item Our findings suggest that there is an important relationship between a project's class size and its maintainability. In general, larger classes tend to be more difficult to maintain and create more complexity when it comes to code changes, bug fixes, and refactoring. Therefore, for optimal software maintainability, developers should strive to keep class sizes as small as possible.
		
		\item Although our analysis provides useful insights into the relationship between class size and software maintainability, there are a few limitations that should be considered. For example, the maintainability scores may not be completely representative of the true difficulty in maintaining the codebase, as this could be affected by a variety of factors, such as code quality, coding conventions used, etc. Also, the class size is not the only metric used to assess the maintainability of a project. Other metrics, such as coupling, cohesion, and cyclomatic complexity, may also impact the maintainability of a project.
	\end{itemize}

	Overall, the findings from this empirical study contribute to the understanding of the relationship between class size and software maintainability and can be valuable for software development practices.
